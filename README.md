# user-authentication

This project creates a registration and login page for the users which is connected to the MongoDb server of the system. We have used node.js and mongodb mainly to create the project. The password of the project is encrypted with the help of "bcrpytjs" whereas the login is done using the jsonwebtoken(JWT).
